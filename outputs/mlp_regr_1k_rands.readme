Train a MLP regressor to predict WALS line accuracy.

For each ? in test data, randomly choose one of the possible values.
Do this 1000 times for each dev line, thus having 1000 candidates for the line.
Run the regressor prediction on the lines and choose the highest scoring line.

Accuracy is 16%.
