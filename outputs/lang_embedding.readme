This model that takes language_id and feature_value_id as input and outputs the probability that feature_value belongs to the language. When we have language embedding the accuracy on KNN can up to 69.9 %. Next idea of how to fill the values is to take all possible values for each feature column and selects the one with the highest probability. This model is able to achieve up to 73.8 %. The CSV file that I uploaded is 73.68 % (usually it is able to stabilize around 72.49 and sometimes jump over 73).
