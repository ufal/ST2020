Conditional probability that feature f = fv given that g = gv
  multiplied by the log count of cooccurrence
  multiplied by the mutual information of features f and g
Only the strongest signal (source feature) is taken, all other source features are ignored.
Unreliable countrycodes=US is replaced by countrycodes=nan.
Latitude and longitude grouped into wide zones; added a combined latlon feature.
