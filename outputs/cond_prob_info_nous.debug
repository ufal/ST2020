83 languages × 192 features would be 15936.
Found 0 nan values.
Found 0 ? values to be predicted.
Found 2282 regular non-empty values.
On average, a language has 27.4939759036145 non-empty features and 19.2289156626506 features to predict.
Minimum knowledge is 8 non-empty features (language ); in that case, 3 features are to be predicted.
Note that the non-empty features always include 8 non-typologic features: ord, code, name, latitude, longitude, genus, family, countrycodes.
